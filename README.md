Here, you'll find lecture notes and Jupyter notebooks I've written while teaching applied mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 

The main focus of the topics is on differential equations and numerical methods, but there's a bit of material on statistics/data science as well. 

*Happy reading! I hope you learn something new : )*
